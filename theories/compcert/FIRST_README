READ ME before you read the README:
Explanation regarding the VST/compcert directory of
the Verified Software Toolchain project.

This VST/compcert directory tree is a subset of the CompCert source tree.
Basically, it is just enough to build Clight.vo and its dependencies.

Every file in this directory tree is verbatim from CompCert EXCEPT:
  FIRST_README, Makefile.config

To create (or to update when there's a new version of compcert),
  ./GRAB ~/compcert
  (see the Usage instructions at the beginning of the GRAB file)

To build (this step is now done automatically in VST's main makefile):
   make exportclight/Clightdefs.vo
