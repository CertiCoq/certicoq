The CertiCoq project

Installation instructions
=========================

Installing dependencies:
------------------------

  To install the compiler, you need Coq.8.5beta2 along with the Template
and ExtLib packages of G. Malecha.  One way to get it is using opam:

  To add the official Coq repositories, you need:

# opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
# opam repo add coq-core-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/core-dev
# opam repo add coq-extra-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev

  Optionally, you might want to create an opam switch for 8.5beta2 using:

# opam switch -A 4.02.1 coq.8.5beta2

  Using switches one can have multiple versions of Coq and associated
packages available at the same time. The -A version instructs to use
that version of the ocaml compiler.

  Then to install coq:

# opam install coq.8.5~beta2 coq-template-coq.1.1.0~beta2 coq-ext-lib

  Then you can pin Coq to this particular version using:

# opam pin add coq.8.5~beta2

  This will ensure opam never tries to update coq in this switch.

Building the compiler:
----------------------

  Once you have a working Coq in your path, you can go to the theories/
 directory. There you can run (once):

# coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile
# make -j4

  This will build the compiler and its proofs.
