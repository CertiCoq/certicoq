(** * VST specs for compiled Coq programs

    The idea is that we want to derive a proof in Verifiable C (VST's separation
    logic) for compiled Coq programs. These specifications will relate the
    original Coq function (rather than L1g abstract syntax) with the compiled C
    code.

    Let [f : A -> B] be a Coq function and [f_in_C : compcert.exp] its
    translation. Then we want:

    forall (a: A) (v : compcert.val),
      {{ rep_A a v }} f_in_C(v)  {{ret. rep_B (f a) ret }}

    
    The separation logic predicate rep_A describes how Coq values of type A are
    laid out as a C data structure.
    
    For instance, if for simplicity we assume that Coq values of type [list A]
    will be represented as a null terminated linked lists, then rep_list will,
    very roughly, be

    Fixpoint rep_list (l: list A) (p: compcert.val) : mpred :=
      match l with
      |  h :: l' => rep_A h p ∗ rep_list l' (offset p 4)
         (* i.e. p is a struct pointer and p.head points to a C value in memory
          * that represents h and p.tail is a struct pointer that represents the
          * rest of the list *)
      |  nil => !! (p = null) && emp
    end.

    Then a C program may call f_in_C, and also we may use the above spec when we
    prove it correct in VST!


    To obtain this triple for a compiled program we'll make use of the
    semantic definition of the triple that (again very roughly) says

    {{ pre }} e {{ post }} iff forall h, pre h -> exists v h', eval (e, h) (v, h') /\ post v h'


    That is, to obtain the top-level theorem we need
        
    forall (a: A) (v : compcert.val) (h : heap),
       rep_A a v h -> exists v' h', eval (app e v, h) (v', h') /\ rep_B (f a) v'


   It should be possible to obtain a similar theorem for L1 -> C light just from
   our compiler correctness theorem.

   The following explains how can we obtain such a theorem for Coq -> L1 to
   eventually compose the two and derive the desired theorem.

  This idea seems to be similar with the one presented in
  https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/58bb/00b882700d67779871a6208f288f68a0b71c.pdf
  where they verify an HOL -> ML extractor.

          rep hd vhd /\ list_rep tl vtl
        | _ => False
      end
  end.

(* For every term f we reify we want to generate a proof that [rep f f_reified].

(* This resembles a lot the approach we follow in QuickChick to automatically
   generate correctness proofs for automatically generated generators. We do the
   proof term generation in OCaml, but I think it would be nice to do it in Coq
   and then reflect the terms. *)
