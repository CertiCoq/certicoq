Installation instructions
=========================

Installing dependencies:
------------------------

  To install the compiler, you need Coq.8.5 along with the Template
and ExtLib packages of G. Malecha.  One way to get it is using opam:

  To add the official Coq repositories, you need:

# opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
# opam repo add coq-core-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/core-dev
# opam repo add coq-extra-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev


  Then to install coq and certicoq's dependencies :

# opam install coq coq-template-coq coq-ext-lib coq-squiggle-eq

If you have already installed some package manually, you can choose the --fake keyword for opam to assume that it is installed, e.g.:
# opam install --fake coq


Alternatively, you can install Coq from source or download a binary from:

https://coq.inria.fr/coq-85

and install the packages from source:

https://github.com/coq-ext-lib/coq-ext-lib
https://github.com/gmalecha/template-coq (branch : coq-8.5)
https://github.com/aa755/SquiggleEq



Updating dependencies:
------------------------

When the above repositories are updated, you may need to update your installation.
If you chose opam, you can do
# opam update
# opam upgrade coq-template-coq coq-ext-lib coq-squiggle-eq 


Building the compiler:
----------------------
  at certicoq/, run

# make -j4 -k

  This will build the compiler and its proofs.

  TODO: Extracted version ?

Troubleshooting:
----------------------

If the above fails, try the following

0) update the dependencies, as explained above

1) "make clean" at certicoq/ and then try to build again. Try "make cleanCoqc" as well.

2) Ensure that your working copy is EXACTLY the same as the contents of SVN repo. Unversioned files and directories should also be removed because they can 
interfere with how Coq resolves imports and how Makefile tracks dependences (via coqdep).

If you are using a git client to access the SVN repo, "git reset HEAD --hard; git clean -xf" ensures that the working copy exactly matches the state of the repository.

If you use the SVN client, there should be something similar:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6204572/is-there-a-subversion-command-to-reset-the-working-copy

3) Is your file system case-insensitive? Please consider using a linux VM. Or,  try making all Require Imports/Exports fully qualified,
so that Coq doesn't import the wrong file because its name differes only in capitalization.
There is tool to help with that:

If errors remain AFTER step 2, please send an email to the certicoq mailing list.
Until step 2, others cannot be sure about the state of the working copy of your machine, so their help may not be applicable.
