The CertiCoq project

Installation instructions
=========================

Installing dependencies:
------------------------

  To install the compiler, you need Coq.8.5 along with the Template
and ExtLib packages of G. Malecha.  One way to get it is using opam:

  To add the official Coq repositories, you need:

# opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
# opam repo add coq-core-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/core-dev
# opam repo add coq-extra-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev


  Then to install coq:

# opam install coq coq-template-coq coq-ext-lib


Alternatively, you can install Coq from source or download a binary from:

https://coq.inria.fr/coq-85

and install the packages from source:

https://github.com/coq-ext-lib/coq-ext-lib
https://github.com/gmalecha/template-coq


Also, the library SquiggleLazyEq needs to be insalled as follows:

git clone https://github.com/aa755/SquiggleLazyEq.git
cd SquiggleLazyEq
make -j6
sudo make install (Alternatively, add "-R `pwd` SquiggleLazyEq" to the coq flags in certicoq/theories/_CoqProject)


Building the compiler:
----------------------

  Once you have a working Coq in your path,
  you can go to the libraries/ directory, and run
  
# coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile
# make -j4

  Then, go to the theories/ directory.
  There you can run (once):

# coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile
# make -j4

  This will build the compiler and its proofs.
