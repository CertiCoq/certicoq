(** *Bookkeeping tactics*)
(**

(*subst for [x:= _] expressions *)
Ltac subst_set:=
  repeat match goal with [a:= _ |- _ ] => subst a end.

(*When repeating tactics, mark terms that haver been used. 
  for example, if you want to apply a tactic to each hypothesis, 
  recursively, you can mark the ones that you have done.
  then delete all marks when you are done.
*)

    Good for keeping track of what subgoal you are in. 
    Mostly for proof exploration/debugging.
*)
